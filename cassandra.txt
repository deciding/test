No leader or master/slave, just coordination
it means each replica is same and can do both r/w
mem: write-> -> 	memtable
			|			|flush
			v			v
disk:	ro,commitlog ro,sstable
timstamp tombstone -> compaction of small sstables when disk full
read: merge unmerged sstables in memory as well as memtable, no. of sstables affect speed
read_repair_chance: 10% by default when <ALL consistency level, the chance to repair other nodes of the agreed data

killrvideo:
1. scalability
2. reliability, downtime
3. ease to use

shard -> failure point -> replica -> failover, sync
